    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in web development and problem solving. I enjoy building simple and responsive websites using HTML and CSS, and I am continuously learning new technologies to improve my skills. I am passionate about understanding how things work rather than just memorizing code. I like exploring new ideas, practicing coding challenges, and working on projects that help me grow as a developer. I am motivated, detail-oriented, and eager to learn and apply my knowledge in real-world applications.
